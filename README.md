# Corporate Design

This project contains all logos and graphical elements of the [4C project](https://github.com/4C-multiphysics/4C) and provides guidance on how to use them.

# Guidelines for using the 4C logo

- The 4C logo is available in block, landscape, and mini formats. The mini format is recommended for spaces less than 60 mm horizontally.
- The standard color version is ideal for presentations, webpages, and general use. 
- For high quality printing, please use the eps version.
- If the background is very dark (e.g., in dark mode in a browser), the negative white version with a transparent background may be a suitable choice.
- The black-and-white version is generally not recommended, but it may be useful in specific cases.

A complete overview of the variants and usage guideline is given [here](4C-logo/4C-logo_overview-and-recommendations.pdf).

# Colors

The blue color in the 4C logo has the hex code `#1d71b8` or `rgba(29, 113, 184, 1)`.
